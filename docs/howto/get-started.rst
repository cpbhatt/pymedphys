Install Python
==============

In order to make use of the PyMedPhys library, you'll need Python installed on
your workstation. On Windows we recommend that you install the
Anaconda Python distribution. Download the latest Anaconda **Python 3** (not 2)
version from `here <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__.

.. note::

    When installing Anaconda make sure to install it for your user only, and
    tick the option "add to path".

On Linux or MacOS we recommend not using your system Python and instead
managing your Python installation using something like `pyenv`_.

.. _`pyenv`: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer#install


Installing PyMedPhys
====================

Once you have Python you can now install PyMedPhys via pip by typing the
following in a terminal or command prompt:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pymedphys

You may need to open and close your terminal if you have only just installed
Python.


A minimal installation
----------------------

The greater majority of PyMedPhys' dependencies are actually optional. They are
only installed for simplicity for new users. You may however choose to install
PyMedPhys without these dependencies by running:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pymedphys --no-deps


Installation on MacOS
---------------------

One of PyMedPhys' dependencies is ``pymssql``. Before installing PyMedPhys on
MacOS you need first install both ``freetds`` via ``homebrew`` and ``Cython``.
To do this follow the steps below:

To install homebrew (as described at <https://brew.sh/>):

.. code:: bash

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then to install ``freetds`` open a new shell, then run:

.. code:: bash

    brew install freetds

And lastly to install cython run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install cython

Then you will be able to successfully run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install pymedphys


Installing the Bleeding Edge version of PyMedPhys
=================================================

If you wish to be able to contribute to PyMedPhys itself you are going to want
to instead install PyMedPhys from the master branch on GitHub
<https://github.com/pymedphys/pymedphys>. To achieve this follow the OS
specific instructions within the contributor tutorials:

* :doc:`advanced/setup-linux`
* :doc:`advanced/setup-win`
* :doc:`advanced/setup-mac`
